This repository contains solutions to Matlab Assignment 3 for DSAA course at IIIT Hyderabad. Report contain details of algorithm implementation, results and observations and answers to the subjective questions (if any).

#### Questions:
1) Perform linear regression on the dataset given in the file houses.csv using methods taught
in the class. The columns in the data file represent size of house (Square feet), no. of
bedrooms & price of house respectively. For this question, split the dataset into two parts:
90% for training and remaining 10% to test your results. (To estimate the correctness of
your solution, generate the L2 norm of predicted and ground truth house prices in the test
set)
	1) What are the coefficients corresponding to each feature of the house? Predict the price
of a house with size 1400 square metres and 4 bedrooms
	2) Does normalizing the feature values help in any ways? Compare the results that you
get with & without normalizing the data
	3) Compute the mean of all the features. Does this pass through the regression line /
plane that you generated?
	4) Can the same method be used to solve this problem if the no. of rows in the data is 1
million? Discuss the computational complexity of the current method.

2) Pick two images f , h of same dimension (256 X 256). Compute their respective
Fourier transforms F, H.
	1) Verify that iDFT[FH] does NOT correspond to the center portion of f * h (convolution).
(For 256 X 256 images, iDFT[FH] would be 256 X 256 but f * h would be 511 X 511)
	2) Compute the average of squared difference between pixel values in iDFT[FH] and the
central 256 X 256 portion of f * h.
	3) What changes do you observe when you zeropad the original images to dimension (511
X 511) and now calculate iDFT[FH] and report the new error.

3) Choose any 64x64 image. Now, add 64 columns and rows of zeros to the right and bottom
side of the original image. Repeat this process two more times each time doubling the image
size and padding the pixels on the right and bottom by zeroes. You will therefore have 4
images first one 64 x 64 with no zero padding and then 128 x 128, 256 x 256 and 512 x
512 after padding. Find the Fourier transform of all these images. Display the results and
explain and justify the relationship between the four outputs you get.

4) To help visually impaired people dial numbers, standard two tone telephones play sinusoids
at two different frequencies every time a key is pressed.
	1) In this problem, you are given a file Q4.mat with signal X and the sampling frequency,
F s. The signal consists of the sound played by a particular key of a two tone telephone.
	2) Your task is to find out the frequencies of this particular key, and clean the noisy signal
as best as you can.

5) A UDP Protocol is one in which data is sent in packets from a source to the client choosing
the best (fastest) possible route. There is no guarantee that the arriving datagrams will be
in the correct sequence. Hence, explicit reordering of chunks of data at the client side is
required in the application layer. You are building an online suite for a streaming service.
You want to build your application in such a manner, that the data that arrives at the client
side, is reordered (before the information is presented to the user, in the application layer)
and outputted to the user.
	1) Design a function reorderDatagram that takes in the downloaded data chunks, and
returns a single data piece (output).
	2) Also, for logging purposes, the correct order needs to be displayed in STDOUT. The
sound samples need to be denoised too. (Hint: The chunks that are created have an
overlap of 3-5 seconds at the ends)

6) The implementation of linear spatial filters requires moving a mask centered at each pixel of
the image, computing sum of products of mask coefficients and corresponding pixels.
	1) Implement an algorithm for low-pass filtering a grayscale image by moving a k k
averaging filter of the form ones(k)/(kË†2).
	2) As the filter is moved from one spatial location to the next one, the filter window
shares many common pixels in adjacent neighborhoods. Exploit this observation and
implement a more efficient version of averaging filter. To appreciate the benefits of
doing so, generate a plot of k vs run-time for various sized images. The plot diagram
should contain a line plot for each image size you pick. Use different marker types
to distinguish the default implementation and improved implementation.

7) Perform linear regression on Altitude.ods. In q1, you would have used the closed form
solution for regression. Now do not use the closed form solution, but arrive at the solution
using gradient descent. There are several approaches to implementing gradient descent as
well which would provide different performences as well. So explore different approaches and
find the best fitting line. Make a detailed report on all your observations. For this question
as well, split the dataset into two parts: 90% for training and remaining 10% to test your
results. You have to implement it from scratch.
